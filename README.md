# ease-auth

This is a React-based web application designed for user authentication, login, password change control, password recovery, registration, and account authentication. While it's currently under development, it will serve as the frontend application for these user management features.

## Project Overview:

The "ease-auth" project interacts with a backend system running on Django and Django REST framework (DRF) available at [FMashi/Authentication](https://github.com/FMashi/Authentication). The backend handles data storage, user management, and authentication, while this React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for these features.

Please note that the "ease-auth" project is a work in progress.
